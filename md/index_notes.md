## Explanatory notes

The HTML source for the [CISSS Outaouais site](https://cisss-outaouais.gouv.qc.ca/language/en/covid19-en/) is accessed daily, the tables are scraped and processed into a tidy dataset, to produce the local (municipal) figures on this site. (I began regularly downloading the HTML source in fall 2020, and used the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to get earlier snapshots.) For the regional and RLS levels, various official datasets are downloaded daily from Quebec government and INSPQ sites; for the data from before I began these daily downloads, I accessed the corresponding files in the [CCODWG Covid19 Canada Archive](http://data.opencovid.ca/archive/index.html). Some historical hospitalization data come from the [Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux (MSSS)](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/covid-19-portrait-quotidien-des-hospitalisations). The latest [opencovid.ca](https://opencovid.ca/) health region data are included for comparison. The source code for downloading and processing all data, and the resulting datasets, are available in the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/timothoms/covid19Outaouais).

Note that while the historical CISSS data consist of the snapshots downloaded daily, and these do not change once they are in the dataset, the other historical datasets shown on this site -- from INSPQ and MSSS -- are re-downloaded in their entirety every day. This means that the latter have the most complete and accurate data available to date, because these datasets are revised daily and corrected retroactively by their authors as new information becomes available. As a results, the most recent statistics in particular (of the last few days) should be considered to be provisional.
