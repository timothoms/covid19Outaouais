It is difficult to find covid-19 trend data over time at the local level for the Outaouais region. The [Quebec government](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/) shows summaries but only the last few days of trends for regions. The Quebec Public Health agency ([Institut national de santé publique du Québec](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees), INSPQ) shows only cumulative snapshots by region and by [Réseaux locaux de services](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees/par-region) (RLS), though detailed historical data at the regional and RLS levels are available from INSPQ with some digging. The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (CCODWG, [opencovid.ca](https://opencovid.ca/)) provides time series data at the provincial and health region levels collected from official sources. However, none of these sources make trend data below the regional level easily accessible. Finally, the [Centre intégré de santé et de services sociaux](https://cisss-outaouais.gouv.qc.ca/language/en/covid19-en/) (CISSS) de l'Outaouais provides frequent (sometimes daily) snapshots by RLS and by municipality, but again no trends. The present project provides local trend data based on these snapshots and regional indicators based on the most complete available data.
