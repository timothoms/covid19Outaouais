## A notes on dates






The COVID-19 data in Quebec page presents data according to two types of date: the actual date of the event (date of declaration, death, sample analysis or hospital admission) and the date known as "Reported" for the tiles at the top of the page.
Actual dates of the event

All data using the "actual date of the event", whether it is the date of notification of the cases, the date of death, the date of analysis of the sample or the date of admission for hospitalizations, are data revised daily and retroactively.

Since there is a delay between the event and its recording in the information system, the evolution data presented by actual dates of events are always underestimated in the most recent days, in particular. especially for cases, deaths and hospitalizations. Due to the delay in entering information and events with a missing date in the system, the cumulative number of events according to the actual date is always lower than the cumulative number according to the reported date ("official report" announced by the government in the "Confirmed cases", "Death" and "Recovered" tiles of the COVID-19 data in Quebec main page).

All the adjustments to the data, such as for example the removal of duplicates, the modifications of living environments or the corrections of the age of a deceased person, are made retroactively on the data by actual dates of events. Thus, the adjustments made in the information system, such as catching up in the entry of death data, will have little impact on the epidemic curve since the affected cases generally spread over a certain period of time.

For all these reasons, data using the actual date of the event presents a better picture of reality than those using the reported date.
Declaration date

The date of declaration of a case corresponds to

    the date of receipt of the declaration by the Regional Directorate of Public Health or, if absent,
    the date of the epidemiological investigation or, if absent,
    the date of entry into the information system.

Date of death

Date entered in the death certificate, which corresponds to the moment when the death was certified by a doctor.
Date of admission

Date of admission to hospital.
Test result date

Date on which the test result is recorded in the laboratory information system.
Date of sample analysis

Date on which the sample was analyzed by a laboratory. The analysis can be done on the same day as the sample is taken or within a few days depending on the capacity of the laboratories.
Date reported

Data by reported date is the data newly entered into the system that is released on government balance sheets every day. These data are cumulative and do not take into account the actual date on which the event took place. For example, among the new deaths shown in brackets in the tiles, some may have occurred several days before. For details on the time of death, see:  https://www.quebec.ca/sante/problemes-de-sante/az/coronavirus-2019/situation-coronavirus-quebec(the link is external).

Data using the reported date is only shown in the Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered Persons tiles at the top of the COVID-19 Data in Quebec main page . Data by reported date is more affected by adjustments or corrections than data presented by actual event date. For example, a removal of duplicates in the system will affect the data by date reported on the day following the correction date.







    The number of confirmed cases per day (depending on the reporting date) is reviewed daily and retroactively.

    The number of confirmed cases per day (according to the date of declaration) is always underestimated for the most recent days due to a delay between the moment of the declaration of the case and the entry of the information in the system. 'information. The days most affected by this delay are presented in a gray area.
