Covid19 Situation in Outaouais
==============================

It is difficult to find covid-19 trend data over time at the local level for the Outaouais region. The [Quebec government](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/) shows summaries but only the last few days of trends for regions. Quebec Public Health (INSPQ) shows only cumulative snapshots by region on its [website](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees), though detailed, complete historical data are available from INSPQ with deeper digging. The [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (opencovid.ca)](https://opencovid.ca/) provides official time series data at the provincial and health region levels. However, none of these sources provide trend data below the regional level. [CISSS Outaouais](https://cisss-outaouais.gouv.qc.ca/language/en/covid19-en/) provides frequent (sometimes daily) snapshots by RÃ©seaux locaux de services (RLS) and by municipality, but again no trends. The present project provides local trend data based on these snapshots and some key regional indicators, shown on the [project website](https://timothoms.github.io/covid19Outaouais/).
