Covid19 Situation in Outaouais
==============================

It is difficult to find covid19 trend data over time at the local level for the Outaouais region. The [Quebec government](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/) shows summaries but only the last few days of trends for regions. [Quebec Public Health](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees) shows only cumulative snapshots by region. The [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (opencovid.ca)](https://opencovid.ca/) collects official time series data at the provincial and health region levels. None of these sources provide trend data below the regional level. [CISSS Outaouais](https://cisss-outaouais.gouv.qc.ca/language/en/covid19-en/) provides frequent (sometimes daily) snapshots by RÃ©seaux locaux de services (RLS) and by municipality, but no trends. The present project provides local trend data based on these snapshots, shown on the [project website](https://timothoms.github.io/covid19Outaouais/).
